# Basics

## Atom composition
***BOHR model***
Bohr model describe the atom in 2D graph it also called planetary model\
it contains **necleus** that has *protons* and *neurtons* it also contains **cloud** that have *electrons* 
- **Protons** (the positive inside the nucleus and this is the number refereing to element e.g. carbon 6, the 6 is protons aka atomic numeber)
- **Electrons** (the negative outside the nucleus)
- **Neutrons** (neutral inside necleus to attract protons to them to prevent protons (+) to be attracted to neutrons (-) this is ture for ant elements that have move than one atomic number)

> - when number of electrons(-) is equal number of protons(+) this is called atom which is equillibium state\
> - when atom ***lose*** electron(s) from outer shell  energy levelit called **+ion**
> - when atom ***gain*** electrons(s) from outer shell energy level it called **-ion**

gaining ion is reduction\
losing ion is oxdizing

## Electronic configuration
if an atom has n electrons, electrons are quantized to certain levels (i.e. electrons should be on some levels not betwen levels)\
n electrons should be distrubuted by electron configuration as follows:\
**S level** hold 2 electrons at max\
**p level** hold 6 electrons at max \
**d level** hold 10 electrons at max \
**f level** hold 14 electrons at max \
and ***level arrangment***
## Electron Configuration Level Arrangement:
1. **1st Energy Level:**
   - 1s (2 electrons)

2. **2nd Energy Level:**
   - 2s (2 electrons)
   - 2p (6 electrons)

3. **3rd Energy Level:**
   - 3s (2 electrons)
   - 3p (6 electrons)
   - 3d (10 electrons)

4. **4th Energy Level:**
   - 4s (2 electrons)
   - 4p (6 electrons)
   - 4d (10 electrons)
   - 4f (14 electrons)

5. **5th Energy Level:**
   - 5s (2 electrons)
   - 5p (6 electrons)
   - 5d (10 electrons)
   - 5f (14 electrons)

## Orbital Filling Order (Aufbau Principle):
Electrons fill orbitals in this specific sequence to minimize energy:

1. 1s  
2. 2s  
3. 2p  
4. 3s  
5. 3p  
6. 4s  
7. 3d  
8. 4p  
9. 5s  
10. 4d  
11. 5p  
12. 6s  
13. 4f  
14. 5d  
15. 6p  
16. 7s  
17. 5f  
18. 6d  
19. 7p

## Electricity 
electricity occurs when a battery of a source pushing electrons throgh conductor and electrical or electronic components\
***conductor*** is something that has free electrons that is steady for being pushed by other electrons coming from battery or a source\
***battery*** has anode and cathode electrodes that push electrons from electrode and attract it from other electrode

# Electrical Properties and Definitions

## Conductivity
**Definition**: Conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct electric current. It indicates how easily charge carriers, such as electrons or holes, can move through the material.

**Unit**: Siemens per meter (S/m)

## Resistivity
**Definition**: Resistivity is a measure of a material's intrinsic resistance to the flow of electric current. It describes how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current.

**Unit**: Ohm meter (Ω·m)

## Electrical Resistance
**Definition**: Electrical resistance is the opposition that a material or component presents to the flow of electric current. It determines how much current will flow for a given voltage.

**Unit**: Ohm (Ω)

## Electrical Conductance
**Definition**: Electrical conductance is the measure of how easily electricity flows through a material. It is the reciprocal of resistance.

**Unit**: Siemens (S)

## Reactance
**Definition**: Reactance is the opposition that capacitors and inductors provide to the flow of alternating current (AC). It varies with the frequency of the AC signal.

**Unit**: Ohm (Ω)

## Impedance
**Definition**: Impedance is the total opposition a circuit offers to the flow of alternating current (AC), combining both resistance and reactance.

**Unit**: Ohm (Ω)

## Capacitance
**Definition**: Capacitance is the ability of a component or circuit to store electrical charge. It measures how much charge a capacitor can hold per unit voltage.

**Unit**: Farad (F)

## Inductance
**Definition**: Inductance is the property of a conductor or coil that opposes changes in current flow. It measures how effectively a coil or inductor can store energy in a magnetic field.

**Unit**: Henry (H)

## Power Dissipation
**Definition**: Power dissipation refers to the conversion of electrical energy into heat within a component due to its resistance. It is an important factor in thermal management of electrical devices.

**Unit**: Watts (W)

# Basics

## Atom composition
***BOHR model***
Bohr model describe the atom in 2D graph it also called planetary model\
it contains **necleus** that has *protons* and *neurtons* it also contains **cloud** that have *electrons* 
- **Protons** (the positive inside the nucleus and this is the number refereing to element e.g. carbon 6, the 6 is protons aka atomic numeber)
- **Electrons** (the negative outside the nucleus)
- **Neutrons** (neutral inside necleus to attract protons to them to prevent protons (+) to be attracted to neutrons (-) this is ture for ant elements that have move than one atomic number)

> - when number of electrons(-) is equal number of protons(+) this is called atom which is equillibium state\
> - when atom ***lose*** electron(s) from outer shell  energy levelit called **+ion**
> - when atom ***gain*** electrons(s) from outer shell energy level it called **-ion**

gaining ion is reduction\
losing ion is oxdizing

## Electronic configuration
if an atom has n electrons, electrons are quantized to certain levels (i.e. electrons should be on some levels not betwen levels)\
n electrons should be distrubuted by electron configuration as follows:\
**S level** hold 2 electrons at max\
**p level** hold 6 electrons at max \
**d level** hold 10 electrons at max \
**f level** hold 14 electrons at max \
and ***level arrangment***
## Electron Configuration Level Arrangement:
1. **1st Energy Level:**
   - 1s (2 electrons)

2. **2nd Energy Level:**
   - 2s (2 electrons)
   - 2p (6 electrons)

3. **3rd Energy Level:**
   - 3s (2 electrons)
   - 3p (6 electrons)
   - 3d (10 electrons)

4. **4th Energy Level:**
   - 4s (2 electrons)
   - 4p (6 electrons)
   - 4d (10 electrons)
   - 4f (14 electrons)

5. **5th Energy Level:**
   - 5s (2 electrons)
   - 5p (6 electrons)
   - 5d (10 electrons)
   - 5f (14 electrons)

## Orbital Filling Order (Aufbau Principle):
Electrons fill orbitals in this specific sequence to minimize energy:

1. 1s  
2. 2s  
3. 2p  
4. 3s  
5. 3p  
6. 4s  
7. 3d  
8. 4p  
9. 5s  
10. 4d  
11. 5p  
12. 6s  
13. 4f  
14. 5d  
15. 6p  
16. 7s  
17. 5f  
18. 6d  
19. 7p

## Electricity 
electricity occurs when a battery of a source pushing electrons throgh conductor and electrical or electronic components\
***conductor*** is something that has free electrons that is steady for being pushed by other electrons coming from battery or a source\
***battery*** has anode and cathode electrodes that push electrons from electrode and attract it from other electrode

# Electrical Properties and Definitions

## Conductivity
**Definition**: Conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct electric current. It is the reciprocal of resistivity and indicates how easily charge carriers can move through the material.

**Unit**: Siemens per meter (S/m)

## Resistivity
**Definition**: Resistivity is a measure of a material's intrinsic resistance to the flow of electric current. It is the reciprocal of conductivity and depends on the material's nature and temperature.

**Unit**: Ohm meter (Ω·m)

## Reactivity
**Definition**: Reactivity in the context of materials refers to how readily a substance undergoes a chemical reaction. For electrical components, this term is less common, but in general chemistry, it describes the tendency of a substance to react with other substances.

**Unit**: Reactivity does not have a specific unit, as it is a qualitative measure of how reactive a substance is.

## Electrical Resistance
**Definition**: Electrical resistance is the opposition that a material presents to the flow of electric current. It is the measure of how much a component resists the flow of current.

**Unit**: Ohm (Ω)

## Electrical Conductance
**Definition**: Electrical conductance is the measure of how easily electricity flows through a material. It is the reciprocal of resistance and indicates the ease with which current can flow through a conductor.

**Unit**: Siemens (S)

## Permittivity
**Definition**: Permittivity is a measure of how much electric field is reduced within a material compared to a vacuum. It indicates how a material affects the electric field in capacitors.

**Unit**: Farads per meter (F/m)

## Permeability
**Definition**: Permeability is a measure of a material's ability to conduct a magnetic field. It indicates how easily a magnetic field can pass through a material.

**Unit**: Henry per meter (H/m)

## Impedance
**Definition**: Impedance is the measure of how much a circuit resists the flow of alternating current (AC). It combines resistance with reactance, which is the resistance due to capacitors and inductors.

**Unit**: Ohm (Ω)

## Reactance
**Definition**: Reactance is the component of impedance that arises from capacitors and inductors in an AC circuit. It represents how much a component opposes AC based on its capacitance or inductance.

**Unit**: Ohm (Ω)

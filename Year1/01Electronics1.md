## 1. Electron and Hole
In semiconductors, **electrons** are the negatively charged particles that carry current. When an electron is excited and moves to the conduction band, it leaves behind an empty state or "hole" in the valence band. This hole behaves as if it were a positively charged particle, and it also contributes to electrical conduction.

## 2. Conductivity
**Conductivity** in semiconductors refers to the ability of the material to conduct electric current. Unlike in metals, where conductivity is mainly due to free electrons, in semiconductors, both electrons and holes contribute to current flow. The conductivity can be modified by factors such as temperature, light exposure, or the addition of impurities (doping).

## 3. Doping (Impurities)
**Doping** involves introducing small amounts of impurities into the semiconductor to change its electrical properties. There are two types of doping:
- **N-type**: Doping with elements that have more electrons than the semiconductor, adding free electrons.
- **P-type**: Doping with elements that have fewer electrons, creating more holes.

These doped regions enhance the material's conductivity by increasing the number of charge carriers.

## 4. Fermi Level
The **Fermi level** is the energy level at which the probability of an electron occupying that state is 50% at absolute zero. In semiconductors, the position of the Fermi level indicates the concentration of electrons and holes. In an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor, the Fermi level is near the middle of the band gap, but doping shifts it closer to the conduction band (N-type) or the valence band (P-type).

## 5. Diffusion
**Diffusion** in semiconductors refers to the process where charge carriers (electrons and holes) move from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. This movement leads to a diffusion current, which plays a key role in the behavior of PN junctions and other semiconductor devices.

## 6. Continuity Equation
The **continuity equation** is a fundamental principle that describes the conservation of charge in a semiconductor. It states that the rate of change of charge density within a volume is equal to the difference between the current entering and leaving the volume. This equation is crucial for analyzing dynamic behaviors in semiconductor devices, such as transistors and diodes.

## 7. PN Junction Theory
A **PN junction** is formed when a P-type semiconductor is joined with an N-type semiconductor. At the junction, electrons from the N-side combine with holes from the P-side, creating a depletion region with a built-in electric field. The voltage-current relationship of a PN junction is non-linear, allowing current to flow easily in one direction (forward bias) but not in the opposite direction (reverse bias).

## 8. Contact Potential
**Contact potential** (or built-in potential) refers to the potential difference across the depletion region of a PN junction when no external voltage is applied. This potential prevents further diffusion of charge carriers across the junction under equilibrium conditions.

## 9. Forward and Reverse Bias
- In **forward bias**, an external voltage is applied to the PN junction such that it reduces the width of the depletion region, allowing current to flow through the junction.
- In **reverse bias**, the external voltage increases the width of the depletion region, preventing current flow except for a small leakage current.

## 10. Capacitance of the Depletion Region (Diffusion Capacitance)
When a PN junction is forward biased, the movement of charge carriers creates a **diffusion capacitance**. This capacitance is related to the change in charge storage as the voltage across the junction changes, and it is significant in high-frequency applications.

## 11. Diode Applications
- **Rectifier Circuits**: Diodes are used in rectifiers to convert AC to DC by allowing current to flow in only one direction. Common configurations include half-wave and full-wave rectifiers.
- **Clipping Circuits**: Diodes in clipping circuits are used to limit the voltage to a desired level, "clipping" off any voltage above or below certain thresholds.

## 12. Zener Diode
A **Zener diode** is a special type of diode designed to operate in reverse bias mode at a specific breakdown voltage known as the **Zener voltage**. It allows current to flow in reverse when the voltage exceeds this threshold, making it useful for voltage regulation in circuits.

# Basics

## Atom composition
***BOHR model***
Bohr model describe the atom in 2D graph it also called planetary model\
it contains **necleus** that has *protons* and *neurtons* it also contains **cloud** that have *electrons* 
- **Protons** (the positive inside the nucleus and this is the number refereing to element e.g. carbon 6, the 6 is protons aka atomic numeber)
- **Electrons** (the negative outside the nucleus)
- **Neutrons** (neutral inside necleus to attract protons to them to prevent protons (+) to be attracted to neutrons (-) this is ture for ant elements that have move than one atomic number)

> - when number of electrons(-) is equal number of protons(+) this is called atom which is equillibium state\
> - when atom ***lose*** electron(s) from outer shell  energy levelit called **+ion**\
> - when atom ***gain*** electrons(s) from outer shell energy level it called **-ion**

gaining ion is reduction\
losing ion is oxdizing

## Electronic configuration
if an atom has n electrons, electrons are quantized to certain levels (i.e. electrons should be on some levels not betwen levels)\
n electrons should be distrubuted by electron configuration as follows:\
**S level** hold 2 electrons at max\
**p level** hold 6 electrons at max \
**d level** hold 10 electrons at max \
**f level** hold 14 electrons at max \
and ***level arrangment*** are ss psps dps dps fdps fdp
## Electricity 
electricity occurs when a battery of a source pushing electrons throgh conductor and electrical or electronic components\
***conductor*** is something that has free electrons that is steady for being pushed by other electrons coming from battery or a source\
***battery*** has anode and cathode electrodes that push electrons from electrode and attract it from other electrode\
